# basic-web-scraper

I have/had a few ideas for apllications that could use a web scraper, hence the need to build one.
I built a basic web scraper that
 - uses Cheerio to scrape the selected data from the enetered URL
 - then uses fs to write the data to file ie data.json
 - set up an express server to hadnle sending the parsed data to the frontend
 - display frontend using basic JavaScript and HTML CSS

It's still a working repository, as I'm always learning.....always!
